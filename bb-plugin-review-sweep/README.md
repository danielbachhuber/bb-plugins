# bb-plugin-review-sweep

A bb sidebar panel listing every open pull request waiting on a review from you,
across all repositories, in one list ordered by what needs you: Now, then Next,
then Later, and oldest request first within each run.

The sweep is deterministic: it runs one `gh` query, classifies the result with
pure functions, and spends no model tokens. An agent is only involved when you
click "Start review" on a row.

## Install on a new machine

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles/bb/plugins/bb-plugin-review-sweep
npm install
bb plugin install . --yes
```

## Requirements

- The [gh-context](../bb-plugin-gh-context) plugin, which keeps the record of
  which threads belong to which pull requests. Without it the panel still lists
  review requests, but none offers to start a thread, since a row cannot tell
  whether it already has one; after a few sweeps without it the plugin reports
  that it needs configuring.
- `gh` on PATH and authenticated as you (`gh auth login`). The plugin reports a
  missing or unauthenticated `gh` as a configuration state, not an error.
- A bb project is needed only for the row action, which matches a PR's
  repository against every git remote in the project's checkout, so a fork's
  upstream counts as well as its origin. PRs in repositories with no matching
  project are still listed; their action reads "No project here" and is
  disabled.

## What lands in the list

One GraphQL query, `is:pr is:open review-requested:@me archived:false`.

`review-requested:` rather than `user-review-requested:` on purpose. The two are
not synonyms: the former also matches a request that reached you through a team
you belong to, which is how most requests arrive in an org, and the narrower
qualifier drops them silently.

Nothing else is filtered. A conflicting PR, a red-CI PR and a bot's dependency
bump are all still review requests, so they are all still listed.

## Why GraphQL rather than `gh pr list`

pr-sweep discovers repositories with `gh search prs` and then fans out one
`gh pr list` per repository, because it needs `mergeable` and every check run
by name. This plugin needs neither: the only checks it shows are the head
commit's counts, which the search query can return.

What it does need is **when the review was requested of you**, and `gh pr list`
has no field for it at any verbosity. The only honest sources are the
`ReviewRequestedEvent` timeline, or a guess from the PR's own timestamps —
and `updatedAt` bumps on every unrelated comment, so a PR that has sat with you
for three weeks would read as "20 minutes". A review queue whose age column is a
guess is not worth having.

So: one `gh api graphql` call, with an exact `requestedAt` per row. The same
call reads `comments { totalCount }`, the count behind each row's "N new", and
the head commit's `statusCheckRollup` counts by state, behind each row's checks.
The reviewers come from the `reviews` and `reviewRequests` it already reads for
the request time. It also
means there is no per-repository partial-failure state to carry; the sweep
either returns the whole queue or fails and keeps the last known rows.

A second call reads the open pull requests in the rows' repositories, for the
stack chips: a stack's other layers are rarely asking you to review, so the
search cannot see them.

`requestedAt` resolves in three steps, so a thin timeline degrades rather than
throwing:

1. The newest request naming your login. Exact.
2. The newest request of any kind. A request reaching you through a team names
   the team and never your login, and the search already guarantees you are a
   requested reviewer.
3. The pull request's own `createdAt`, if the timeline window did not reach the
   event.

## How the list is ordered

Every review request is in one run, and every run is in one tier. The summary
squares above the list show one square per request, grouped by run and counted
("2 to review"). Pressing a run shows only its requests; pressing it again
shows them all.

| Tier | Runs, in order |
| --- | --- |
| Now | re-review, waiting too long, reviewing |
| Next | to review |
| Later | drafts, ignored, folded after five |

- **Re-review**: you reviewed it, the author pushed, and it came back. The
  author is blocked on you, and it is usually the quickest row to clear, so it
  comes first, even with a thread running. An ignored or draft re-review goes
  to ignored or drafts instead.
- **Waiting too long**: requested of you at least "Stale after (days)" ago,
  counted in whole days.
- **Reviewing**: a review thread has been started, whether or not the request
  is ignored or a draft.
- **To review**: every other request.
- **Drafts**: a draft was assigned to you: a real request, but not offered for
  review yet.
- **Ignored**: put off with "Ignore for 48 hours". It comes back on its own
  when the time is up.

Within a run, the oldest request comes first, tie-broken by repository then
number, so rows do not reshuffle between sweeps. Every row is open, with its
title line, banner, icons, note, and actions, since each request is one for
you to do. There is no chevron to close one.

The sidebar count is requests with no thread that are neither ignored nor
drafts. Before it, a red circle counts the ones waiting too long, as Now
counts its urgent rows.

## Each row

Each row is drawn the way PR Sweep draws a pull request. The title line has
the pull request icon (green when open, muted for a draft), the title, the
number, "N new" in blue when comments were posted since you last opened the
pull request or its thread from the panel, and how long ago the review was
requested of you on the right. The first sweep to see a request records its
comment count, so nothing is new on the first sync.

A pull request in a stack, built on another open pull request's branch or
with one built on its own, has a chip after its number: "3 of 5 · on #612",
with the number linking to the pull request below it, or "1 of 5 · base" at
the bottom. Two pull requests on one base share an index, and the count is
every open pull request in the stack, whoever opened it. Rows keep their place
in the list, so a stack's layers can sit apart. The stacks come from one more
GraphQL call per sweep, reading the open pull requests in each swept
repository; a failure there drops the chips, not the sweep.

Under the title, a banner appears for two kinds of request:

- **Waiting on you for N days**, in red, for a request in the waiting too long
  run. The row keeps its red tint and bar.
- **Asked to review again**, in blue, for a re-review.

A row in the reviewing run has an orange left edge and a faint orange wash, in
the same orange as its squares.

Then a line of icons:

- the author's picture and login
- the reviewers' pictures, yours first, each with a badge for where their
  review stands: pending while a request is outstanding, otherwise their
  latest approval, change request, or dismissal, or a comment if that is all
  they left. A team shows its organization's picture. You are in it when you
  were asked by name or have reviewed; a request only to your team shows the
  team.
- the head commit's checks as a count, such as a green tick with "13/13", an
  amber clock while any run, or a red cross with "2/15 failing". Hovering it
  names every count. Left out when the pull request has no checks.
- the size in lines added and removed ("+18 −4")
- the repository, only when more than one is in play
- when an ignored request returns

On a one-line Later row, the icons sit inline in place of the age.

The age is how long ago the review was requested of you, read from the
`ReviewRequestedEvent` timeline described above, not from the pull request's
own timestamps.

A row has no stage track on the right, unlike Issue Sweep's: the banner and
the icons say where a review stands.

An open row's actions are Start review or Open thread; Archive thread on a row
with a thread, Stop ignoring on an ignored one, or Ignore for 48 hours on the
rest; Add note or Edit note; and Copy link. The Harvest clock, when the Harvest
plugin is installed, sits at the right end of that line.

A note is a one-line next step, stored only on this machine and never sent to
GitHub. Save or Enter saves it, Cancel or Escape cancels, and saving an empty
note deletes it.

## Settings

- **Sync interval** — how often the background sweep runs. Default 5 minutes.
- **Path to the gh CLI** — override when `gh` is not on the server's PATH.
- **Only show repositories checked out here** — on by default. A review request
  is shown only when a bb project on this machine has that repository as one of
  its checkout's git remotes, upstream as readily as origin. bb's project
  list is per-installation, so this is what separates the computer a repository
  is checked out on from every other one: the work laptop's repositories stop
  filling the personal one's panel. The skipped repositories are named under
  the list, so an empty panel never reads as a cleared queue.
- **Also show these repositories** — comma or newline separated `owner/name`,
  for a repository you review in without a checkout here. Ignored when the
  filter is off.
- **Stale after (days)** — how many whole days a request can wait before it
  moves into Now as waiting too long, flagged "Waiting N days". Default 2.
- **Model for review threads** — blank takes the provider's default. There is
  only one action here, so this is a single value rather than pr-sweep's
  model-by-action JSON.
- **Provider for spawned threads** — defaults to `claude-code`, the provider
  whose `code-review` command the prompt names. Blank uses bb's default.
- **Permission mode for spawned threads** — defaults to `full`. Read the next
  section before changing it.

## What a spawned thread may do

**It reports findings in the thread. It posts nothing to GitHub without asking.**

Reviewing someone else's pull request is outward-facing in a way pushing to your
own branch is not: a wrong finding lands publicly on a colleague's PR and cannot
be quietly undone. So unlike pr-sweep, whose prompt authorizes its own commit
and push, this prompt withholds that authorization and says so explicitly.

Two things make that instruction load-bearing rather than decorative.

**The skill may try to post on its own.** Two commands answer to `code-review`
on this machine: the built-in one, which posts only when passed `--comment`, and
the claude-plugins-official one, whose final step runs `gh pr comment` with no
flag to suppress it. Which one a spawned thread resolves is not something this
plugin controls. The prompt therefore names the skill *and* states the
constraint, including the case where the skill's own last step posts a comment —
a direct user instruction outranks a skill's steps.

**The sandbox cannot enforce it.** `auto` keeps the workspace sandbox, which
blocks network egress, so a thread in that mode cannot reach GitHub to read the
diff it was started for. `full` is the only mode in which a review can happen at
all, and it has no way to express "may read GitHub, may not write to it". The
no-posting rule lives in the prompt, not in the permission mode. Worth knowing
before trusting it unattended.

## Threads

"Start review" opens bb's composer in a dialog, so you can read and edit the
prompt first. A thread started from a row is linked to its pull request in gh-context, and
the row then opens that thread rather than starting another. A review thread
is not on the pull request's branch, so bb itself finds no pull request for it;
gh-context's banner above the composer shows the one this plugin linked.

## Relationship to pr-sweep

`bb-plugin-pr-sweep` covers pull requests *you authored*; this one covers
requests *made of you*. They are deliberately separate plugins, which means
`review/spawn-target.ts`, `review/store.ts`, the `gh` runner and the vendored
`components/` are a second copy of pr-sweep's. What the two draw for a pull
request (the icon, the reviewer avatars, the checks badge, and the size) comes
from `sweep-ui/pull-request`, so a row looks the same on both tabs.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # vitest
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
bb plugin dev     # rebuild and reload on save
```

**All test fixtures are synthetic.** This repository is public. Never paste real
pull request titles, reviewer logins, repository names, or URLs into a test.
